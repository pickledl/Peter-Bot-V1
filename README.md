# Peter-Bot-V1

Peter Bot is a bot that simply creates a ‘Peter Alert’ pop-up window.

Every few seconds after you run the file 'Start Peter Bot.bat', there is a chance of a Peter Alert window appearing. 

'peterpopup1.vbs' activates the Peter pop-up window. The batch file is unneeded for this, but it would make a pretty cool prank if you minimized the command window on your friend's computer.

Opening the vbscript file a bunch of times would look something like this.

I don't know what else to put here, so heres a soliloquy I wrote a while ago:




Peter Alert is a seemingly meaningless pop-up window with no previous mentions. However there is much more to this sprite. Precisely 9355 minutes ago, I stumbled upon a low-quality photo of a suspicious pop-up window with Peter Griffin’s face plastered on it. It had the title “Peter Alert” and one (1) button with the word “OK” on it. It also had the default X button in the upper right corner with no option to minimize or hide the window. It was a very unusual yet stunning sight.  It has been shared upon many modern social media apps such as TikTok, YouTube, and many more. It began picking up popularity from all around the world, appearing on many screens throughout its lifespan. This image has inspired many people to recreate it. It’s not just some regular pop-up window; it’s a whole internet culture, who many — including I — follow.
