# Peter-Bot-V1

Peter Bot is a bot that simply creates a ‘Peter Alert’ pop-up window.

Every few seconds after you run the file 'Start Peter Bot.bat', there is a chance of a Peter Alert window appearing. 

'peterpopup1.vbs' activates the Peter pop-up window. The batch file is unneeded for this, but it would make a pretty cool prank if you minimized the command window on your friend's computer.

Opening the vbscript file a bunch of times would look something like this.
